# Power Trip

## Description
Use Power Trip to track your travels! Users can create an account and log in which will take them a homepage that lays out previous trips as well as planned trips for the future. We created this app for people who want to go everywhere. Plans for future development would include adding a "friend' feature, so that users can see where their friends have gone, pictures, as well as their rating of the trip overall.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to see and rate my trips, so I can decide where I would return and where I would like to go in the future.

## Installation
Necessary dependencies can be installed by running "npm i" through command line.

## Usage
To begin using the application, users must create an account and log in. From there they can begin creating trips and uploading pictures.
